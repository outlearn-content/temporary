## Overview

### **Start the Sandbox VM and Open Ambari**

Start the HDP Sandbox following the [Sandbox Install Guide](http://hortonworks.com/products/hortonworks-sandbox/#install) to start the VM:

![Lab0_1](http://hortonworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Lab0_1.png)

Once you have installed the Sandbox VM, it resolves to the host on your environment, the address of which varies depending upon the Virtual Machine you are using(Vmware, VirtualBox etc). As, a general thumb rule, wait for the installation to complete and confirmation screen will tell you the host your sandbox resolves to. For example:

In case of VirtualBox: host would be 127.0.0.1

![Lab0_2](http://hortonworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Lab0_2.png)

If you are using a private cluster or a cloud to run sandbox. Please find the host your sandbox resolves to.

Append the port number :8888 to your host address, open your browser, and access Sandbox Welcome page at http://_host_:8888/.

Navigate to Ambari welcome page using the url given on Sandbox welcome page.

Both the username and password to login are admin.

> **NOTE****![sign](http://hortonworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/sign.png)**  If you want to search for the host address your sandbox is running on, ssh into the sandbox terminal upon successful installation and follow subsequent steps:

1.  login using username as “root” and password as “hadoop”.
2.  Type ifconfig and look for inet address under eth.
3.  Use the inet address, append :8080 and open it into a browser. It shall direct you to Ambari login page.
4.  This inet address is randomly generated for every session and therefore differs from session to session.
